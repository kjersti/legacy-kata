# Practicing continous integration 

You are a new member of a small team developing software that handles a weird shop named the Gilded Rose. The shop sells various odd items from different suppliers, and the software they have built keeps track of when they need to sell their inventory by, and the quality of the items. 

The main program will list out the inventory of today, and the calculated sell in days and quality for the next 31 days.
