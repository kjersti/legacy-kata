# Practicing continous integration and trunk-based development

You are a new member of a small team developing software that handles a weird shop named the Gilded Rose. The shop sells various odd items from different suppliers, and the software they have built keeps track of when they need to sell their inventory by, and the quality of the items. 

The main program will list out the inventory of today, and the calculated sell in days and quality for the next 31 days. 

There is a requirements documents listed [here](requirements.md). This is where you'll find the documentation of the current system, and also the new features the team is tasked to implement. 


## Instructions

- Decide how you want to do the work as a team. 
- I'll be reminding you to push your code often, it should not be more than 10 minutes between pushes, excluding breaks. 
- You can only push to the main branch.
- If the build fails, everyone on the team must stop working, and figure out what the problem is and fix that, before moving on with the other tasks. 
- There is a step in the build pipeline that's called verify production, and that checks that the system works as expeted. When you think a feature is done, let me (the shop owner) know, 
  so I can verify that the feature is implemented, and update the verify production step. 
- Every hour we will have  a 5 minute break 
- You decide if you want to have the camera on or off
- If you want to work with one or more of your team-mates, let me know and I'll create a breakout room for you on teams.
